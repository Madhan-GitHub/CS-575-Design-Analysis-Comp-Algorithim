Programming language used : Python

****************************************************************************************************************************************************
Note:

The program is a given as a python file which can be executed in any python environment (Spyder, Jupyter, PyCharm, etc).
The input file contains the test case which is imported by the program by itself.
The output file is written after the program is run.

****************************************************************************************************************************************************
Implemented Algorithm:

* This program takes an array from a text file, implemented using file handling in python.
* The program then reads the elements of the array and computes its distance.
* And it computes the distance between the other coordinates/points.
* Them it captures the minimum distance comparing with other values using DAC.
* The output is stored in the an output file showing the distance and its coordinates.

TIME COMPLEXITY:

-> Since I have used arrays computation and DAC approach, its time complexity will be of nlogn.
